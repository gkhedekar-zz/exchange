Idea:
App to let people exchange things they own for something they want to own without involving money. Its like the old barter system.

User Input/Data:
1. Users will post a list of things that they own and they are willing to exchange with the estimated price.
2. Users will create a list of items that they want to possess (wish list) and the price range

Based on the user inputs, the app will suggest list of items that the user can exchange for some other item within some margin of price range.

Algorithm to give suggestion should include:
1. users wish list
2. location - proximity to the user
3. price range
4. item category

Advanced: It should also suggest something by combining related/random items that user has.

Trending items based on location, demand - so that users can think if they have that itema and are willing to exchange.

** Time limit for the exchagne. For example: i want to borrow the a game for a month and then give it back.

version 1: Items only less than $1500 and only in areas in seattle and around.
